# About Lucecu

*Lucec√∫* is the Xabaril repository for custom DotNet templates. Our goal is to simplify the initial scaffolding of some scenarios where DotNet does not have a template yet.

At the moment, the templates included in this repository are:

- [K8S Operator pattern](#k8s-operator-pattern-template)

## How to build

Lucecu is built against the latest NET Core 3.

- [Install](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/current) the [required](https://github.com/Xabaril/Esquio/blob/master/global.json) .NET Core SDK
- Run dotnet new -i ./src/templates/k8soperator in the root of the repo for building k8s template.

## K8S Operator pattern template

This template creates the default scaffolding project to create a Kubernetes operator, including:

- Project scaffolding
- A Simple CRD
- YAML templates for deploy CRD
- A CRD watcher
- A Kubernetes controller with Kubernetes client dependency

 To get more information, please checkout our [Getting Starting with K8S Operator template](./docs/GettingStarted-K8SOperator.md)
